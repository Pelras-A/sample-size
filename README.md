# RECQUIRED SAMPLE SIZES

<div style="text-align: justify">

This page is devoted to the calculation of the number of patients required for several studies such as an randomized clinical trial (RCT) for causal inference or a cohort for constructing or validating a predictive tool. R codes are proposed. We can click [here](https://poitiers-health-data.shinyapps.io/SampleSize/) to access to the related user-friendly calculators. Some reminders:

* **Superiority RCT:** Use to demonstrate that the experimental treatment is more effective than standard therapy.

* **Non-inferiority RCT:** Use to demonstrate that the experimental treatment is as effective as standard therapy.

* **Sequential RCT:** Intermediate analyses for early stopping the study.

* **Stepped wedge RCT:** Clusters are randomized sequentially to cross from control to experimental intervention <sup>1</sup>.

<summary>PROPORTION ENDPOINT</summary>
<br>

*Consider the following binary endpoint descriptive study. In order to demonstrate the expected proportion of event of 35% with a precision define by a 10% width confidence interval and a 5% two-sided type I error rate, the minimum sample size needed is 350 patients.**

```r
sampleSize <- function(p=0.35, alpha=0.05, width=0.1){
  Z <- qnorm(1-alpha/2)
  (((2*Z)**2)*(p*(1-p)))/(width**2)
}

sampleSize()

#> [1] 349.5728
```

**Input parameters:**
* p : expected proportion of event
* alpha : recquired type I error rate

In order to demonstrate such a difference of 6 units, with a standard deviation of 23, a 5% two-sided type I error rate and a power of 80%, the minimum sample size per arm equals 231 (i.e., a total of 462 patients).*

*Consider O/E the ratio between the number of observed events versus expected ones. To achieve a precision defined as a length of the (1-Î±)% confidence interval of this ratio equals to 0.2, if the expected proportions is 50%, the required sample size is 386 (Riley et al. Minimum sample size for external validation of a clinical prediction model with a binary outcome. Statistics in Medicine. 2021;19:4230-4251).*

```r
se <- function(width, alpha) # The standard error associated with the 1-alpha confidence interval
{
  fun <- function(x) { exp( qnorm(1-alpha/2, mean=0, sd=1) * x ) - exp(-1* qnorm(1-alpha/2, mean=0, sd=1) * x ) - width } 
  return(uniroot(fun, lower = 0.001, upper = 100)$root)
} 

size.calib <- function(p, width, alpha) # the minimum sample size to achieve this precision
{   
  (1-p) / ((p * se(width=width, alpha=alpha)**2 ))
}

size.calib(p=0.5, width=0.2, alpha=0.05)

#> [1] 385.4265
```
**Input parameters:**
* p: expected proportion of events
* width: size of the (1-Î±)% confidence interval
* alpha: type I error rate (Î±)
