# RECQUIRED SAMPLE SIZES

<div style="text-align: justify">

This page is devoted to the calculation of the number of patients required for several studies such as an randomized clinical trial (RCT) for causal inference or a cohort for constructing or validating a predictive tool. R codes are proposed. We can click [here](https://poitiers-health-data.shinyapps.io/SampleSize/) to access to the related user-friendly calculators. Some reminders:

* **Superiority RCT:** Use to demonstrate that the experimental treatment is more effective than standard therapy.

* **Non-inferiority RCT:** Use to demonstrate that the experimental treatment is as effective as standard therapy.

* **Sequential RCT:** Intermediate analyses for early stopping the study.

* **Stepped wedge RCT:** Clusters are randomized sequentially to cross from control to experimental intervention.

<em>
Consider the following RCT with two parallel groups with a 1:1 randomization ratio and 2 planned intermediate analyses for efficacy by using the O'Brien-Fleming method for considering the inflation of the type I error rate. The expected proportion of event is 11% in patients in the experimental arm versus 15% units in the control arm. In order to demonstrate such a difference of 4%, with a 5% two-sided type I error rate and a power of 80%, the final analysis should be carried out on 2,256 patients (1,128 patients per group). The first and second intermediate analyses would be performed on 752 and 1,504 patients respectively, i.e. 33% and 66% of the maximum number of included patients if their is no decision of stopping the study.

  <summary>No intermediate analysis : Stepped wedge randomization</summary>

<em>
Consider the following stepped wedge RCT with 15 centers randomized in 5 sequences. The expected proportion of events is 72% in patients in the control arm and no difference compared to the experimental arm. Assuming an absolute non-inferiority margin of 8%, the minimum sample size per arm equals 390 (i.e., a total of 780 patients) to achieve a one-sided type I error rate of 5% and a power of 80%, in case of individual randomization with a 1 :1 ratio. According to our stepped wedge design and assuming an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.01, we need to recruit 1,890 patients (945 in each arm). (Hemming K, Taljaard M.
